//for some reason i feel like there is a more efficient way to code all of this...i used too many for loops, making the code tedious to follow through. i also feel as if there was definitely a way to code createEyes() better. i don't think i needed the constants twoYellow or twoBlack. yet i did not know how to code it otherwise.
