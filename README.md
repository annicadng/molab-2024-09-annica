# Swift Programming Overview
I decided to go with option 2 for learning Swift programming. I've totaled around 4 hours of studying Days 1 - 7. Some topics, like variables, constants, and loops, were ones I had already learned about with my previous coding experience. However, I noticed that the syntax is a little bit different than what I am used to. For example, for loops are written as **for x in y** or **for x in 1...12** rather than the recognized **for(i=0;i<12;i++)**. It'll take me a little bit of adjusting in order to get to a point where I can naturally code things out in Swift. For now, it feels like I am learning a new language, despite my knowledge of other similar programming languages.
